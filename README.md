# DotCollector
Dots (conceptually a text for now) can be sent by a web client and a central server can pull the dots for processing or show insights to end-users.
This project aims at creating a simple bootstrap for Read/Write queries based on a Mongo powered Cloud NoSQL Backend, React (without JSX), Express, NodeJS.

Think of it as an amazingly simple yet massively scalable system! That opens opportunities for the following sample applications:

1. Acknowledging digital-ads fueled transactions on browsers
2. IoT based data collection to analyze device health
3. In an office setting, to analyze the performance of employees in real-time.
4. Conduct live short-time surveys
5. Endless more opportunities!
